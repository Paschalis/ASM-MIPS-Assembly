## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Read and Display a Number
Write a MIPS assembly program that reads and displays a number on the screen. The program should provide a prompt message before reading the number from the keyboard to guide the user.

### Exercise 2: Read and Display Three Numbers
Write a MIPS assembly program that reads and displays three numbers on the screen. The program should use prompt messages for reading and displaying the numbers.

### Exercise 3: Addition of Two Numbers
Create an assembly program that adds two numbers initially loaded into registers t1 and t2. The result should go to t3 and be displayed on the screen.

### Exercise 4: Addition of User-input Numbers
Implement an assembly program that adds two numbers given each time from the keyboard. The result should go to t3 and be displayed on the screen.

### Exercise 5: Calculate the Difference
Create an assembly program that calculates the difference between two numbers given each time from the keyboard. The result should go to t3 and be printed on the screen.

### Exercise 6: Display Name Multiple Times
Implement an assembly program that displays your name 10 times on the screen, using line breaks for readability.

### Exercise 7: Conditional Comparison
Write an assembly program that reads two numbers from the keyboard, a and b. It checks if a < b, a > b, or a = b, and displays the corresponding message on the screen.

### Exercise 8: Finding Zeros of a Function
Write an assembly program to find the integer values of x that zero the function f(x) = ax^2 + bx in the interval [X1, X2]. The values of a, b, X1, and X2 should be entered from the keyboard. If the function does not zero in the interval [X1, X2], display the message "end of program."

### Exercise 9: Counting Positive, Negative, and Zero Numbers
Write an assembly program that reads integer numbers from the keyboard and stores them in memory, creating an array of 10 positions. It finds the number of positive, negative, and zero numbers in the array and displays them.

### Exercise 10: Finding the Largest Number in an Array
Write an assembly program that creates an array of 10 positions and finds the largest number in the array.

### Exercise 11: Adding Arrays
Write an assembly program that creates two arrays of 10 elements each. Then, create a third array with the sum of the corresponding elements of the two arrays and display the elements of the third array.

### Exercise 12: Manipulating Array Elements
Write a program that creates an array of 6 elements, calculates the smallest number, adds it to each element of the array, and then displays the elements in reverse order from input.

### Exercise 13: Swapping Array Elements
Write a program that fills two one-dimensional arrays A and B with ten positions each, swaps the elements of the arrays, and then displays the contents of the arrays to verify the process.

### Exercise 14: Sum of Products
Write an assembly program to calculate the sum of products 1*2 + 2*3 + 3*4 + 4*5 + ... where the user specifies how many products to add each time.

### Exercise 15: Counting Even and Odd Numbers
Write a program that continuously reads numbers from the keyboard until the number zero is given. When zero is entered, print the number of even and odd numbers given up to that point.

### Exercise 16: [Calculate the sum of cubes from 1 to 10]
Write a program to calculate the $\sum_{i=1}^{10} i^{3}$


## How to Use
# Running MIPS Assembly Programs with SPIM on Linux

To run a MIPS assembly program with SPIM on the terminal in Linux, follow these steps:

1. **Install SPIM**: If not already installed, you can install SPIM using your package manager.

2. **Write your MIPS assembly program**: Save your MIPS assembly program with a `.s` extension.

3. **Open a terminal**.

4. **Navigate to the directory containing your assembly file**.

5. **Run the program using SPIM**: spim -file your_program.s
